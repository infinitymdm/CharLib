Introduction

Charlib is an open-source standard cell library characterizer. It focuses on accuracy, ease of use,
and fast runtime (in that order).

- Supports characterization of combinational and sequential cells
- Plots timing and I/O voltages
- Supports non-linear delay models in the Liberty file format (``.lib``)
- Runs characterization in parallel on multiple cores
- Easy-to-use, with YAML-based configuration
- Implemented in Python 3 with a modified PySpice backend
- Compatible with ngspice and Xyce

Additional features are being worked on constantly. If there's something you'd like CharLib to do,
please `request a new feature <https://stineje.github.io/CharLib/chapters/05_contributing.html#requesting-new-features>`_.
